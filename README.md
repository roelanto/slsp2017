This directory contains all files required to replot plots for the SLSP17-poster. 

To rerun some of the analyses, the real source data is needed. For
privacy reasons, that data has been omitted - private scripts and data
are stored in a `local/` directory that is not committed to a public
repository. Contact the [author](r.a.ossewaarde@rug.nl) to obtain these
files.

Intermediate (aggregate) data is anonymized and available in the
`data_and_models` directory. The results of the VAD-analysis (ie: the
pauses themselves) are in
`data_and_models/aggregate_data/vadresults.Rdata`.
